Profiles Plugin
===

Plugin for Paper/Spigot and Waterfall/Bungeecord that adds player profile slots/character slots, by applying authentically FAKE UUID's to players to allow seperate player data for the player. 

This code was forked from the origin dev and re-coded to work with Java 16 and Spigot 1.16.5 API. 
You're more then welcome to import this project and build it with "shadowJar" button, but please not this fork is designed for Stone Legion rpg server implementations.
